README for NetWalk v0.2

I tried a shareware Windows game called NetWalk once. I liked the idea so
I decided to implement my own so I could play in Linux, and customize it more.

NetWalk is a puzzle game where the object is to connect every terminal to the
main server. (These are represented by coloured boxes, so I guess you could
also imagine them to be water mains, electricity cables, phone lines, etc.)
Clicking on a square will rotate its contents, a left click performs an
anticlockwise rotation and a right click performs a clockwise rotation.

In this version, not only must every terminal be connected, but every piece of
cable must also be connected to the main server somehow.

Keys: F2 starts a new game.
