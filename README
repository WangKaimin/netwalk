README for NetWalk v0.3
Ben Lynn

INTRODUCTION

I tried a shareware Windows game called NetWalk once. I liked the idea so
I decided to implement my own so I could play in Linux, and customize it more.

NetWalk is a puzzle game where the object is to connect every terminal to the
main server. (These are represented by coloured boxes, so I guess you could
also imagine them to be water mains, electricity cables, phone lines, etc.)

In this version, not only must every terminal be connected, but every piece of
cable must also be connected to the main server somehow.

This project is written in SmallEiffel.

USAGE

Click on a square to rotate its contents. A left click performs an
anticlockwise rotation and a right click performs a clockwise rotation.

You can select presets, or make a custom game in the options window.

There is one shortcut key: F2 starts a new game.

Edit the "config" file to configure the game and add presets.
