    Playable.

    ...

    Cleanup in preparation for release.

    Very hard to improve, because I keep playing it instead of
    coding.

    Realized my best move counter is flawed: need to ignore
    reflections.

    Added "New Game" and "Options" buttons.

    WIDGET's put_geometry all wrong? Container class should handle offsets
    instead?

    Added options window.

    Added "Quit" button, handles SDL_QUIT event.

    Can adjust height, width.

    Some Makefile fixes, changed win32.config to DOS text file.
