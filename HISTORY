    Playable.

    ...

    Cleanup in preparation for release.

    [netwalk-0.1.tgz]

    Very hard to improve, because I keep playing it instead of
    coding.

    Realized my best move counter is flawed: need to ignore
    reflections.

    Added "New Game" and "Options" buttons.

    WIDGET's put_geometry all wrong? Container class should handle offsets
    instead?

    Added options window.

    Added "Quit" button, handles SDL_QUIT event.

    Can adjust height, width.

    Some Makefile fixes, changed win32.config to DOS text file.

    [netwalk-0.2.tgz]

    Added timer.

    Fixed another par calculation caveat: if the server has all
    four port connected, then rotations shouldn't count at all.

    Got rid of compilation warnings.

    GUI code cleanup.

    High score table for "standard" games (9x10).

    TODO's:
	- have buttons for presets: e.g. easy, expert, elite, evil,
    that range from small no wrap games to the largest possible wrap game.
    Or inane, ???, insane, inhuman.
    Or newbie, normal, nerd, neverending/nonsense.
	- record high scores in each category.
	- find a GPL font.
	- put C code in package.

    Then can submit on Freshmeat?

    For first game, PRNG seeded with current time.

Wed Apr 24 16:50:51 PDT 2002
    Now uses GPL fonts so it'll work out of the box.
    Fixed time bug: wasn't updating with system time.

Sat Apr 27 16:00:51 PDT 2002
    Added primitive listbox widget, can choose preset games.

    High score window now displays one high score per preset.

    Saves high scores to file.

    Added stuff to README.

    [netwalk-0.3.tgz]

Mon Jun  3 15:21:17 PDT 2002
    Finally added C code for people without SmallEiffel.

    Added minor version number.

    [netwalk-0.3.1.tgz]
