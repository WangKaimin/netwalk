    Just realized it crashes on my XP laptop.
    After some code cleanup, the bug mysteriously disappeared.
    [netwalk-0.4.1.tgz]

    Released first C version.

    Forgot to remove one hardcoded colour (0xffffff for the pulse colour).

    Added "showmoves" configuration option.

    Added high scores. Code is very crufty now, will cleanup after release.

    Handles SDL_Quit event, doesn't try to initialize audio.

Sun Jan  2 22:23:14 PST 2003
    Added no_fourway option.

    More kludges: widget->localx and localy store relative coordinates,
    call widget->computexy() to compute screen coordinates. Submenu items
    locations are computed on the fly.

    Added menu items to change difficulty level, resizes window automatically.

    Cleaned up colour code. (Eliminated many SDL_MapRGB()'s)

    GUI pretty boring. I pick at it every now and then.
    Got around to implementing wrap.

    Confused about implementing menus. Code is terrible, but it works.

    Started GUI. Doing OOP in C.

Thu Nov  7 10:56:02 PST 2002
    Added animation when you win.

Thu Nov  7 00:15:07 PST 2002
    Restarted project in C. I'm in an anti-OOP phase.
    Playable, but missing a few features from my Eiffel version, notably
    the GUI.
